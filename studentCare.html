                It is inappropriate for us to comment on other centres.  However, we take pride in what we do well.  We believe that a good student care centre must have core values of investment, commitment and customer orientation, and that is what we commit ourselves to.

                Firstly, we made the appropriate investment on our premises at the beginning when we took over the place. As we are located in a CD shelter at the basement of a HDB block, we ensured that we had a bright, clean, safe and well ventilated environment. Secondly, we ensure that we hire good teachers who are able to teach the levels that they are assigned. We also only select teachers who are passionate about teaching and who love children. This is a continuous commitment on our part. We provide coaching for new teachers. Besides, we also provide very good teaching resources for the teachers to do their jobs well. We are also committed to help all our children to improve both academically and morally regardless of their family background or learning ability. The outstanding results demonstrated by our kids in the past years have proven that we were heading the right direction. Lastly, we take parents’ feedback seriously and we address their concerns through innovative solutions.

                Before we talk about the process, let us touch on our results. On a Macro basis, our students performed very well. Our 2010 P1 batch produced several school prize recipients. More than half of our 2011 P1 batch scored above 85% average marks. On a micro level, we had quite a few students who were doing pretty average before joining us, i.e they either failed or passed marginally turned their results around within a year or two. Some of them had gone on to be among the top students in class and some had even moved to the top classes. In fact, quite a few had already left our Student Care and yet they continued to do well because we had not only helped them unleash their potential, but had also cultivated in them a keen and independent learning attitude.</p>

<p>There is no single process or action that we took could explain our success. It is through a combination of many strategies that we adopted that created the good results. The key elements that we look at are discipline, motivation, students’ interest, the learning styles and learning differences of the students. We design our curriculum to maximize results taking all these into account.

              <p>
                Ill discipline is one of the greatest challenges of other student care or before & after school care centres.  Do we have these issues, and how do we manage them?

              <p>
                We adopt a zero tolerance level for ill discipline. We are indeed as concerned as the parents to ensure that our younger kids are not affected by bad behaviors of the older kids. Fortunately, as we built our student base from zero, we did not have to deal with any legacy issue. We would not hesitate to terminate any student who continues to defy teachers’ instructions.

                What is our student care schedule during school holidays?  Do we have special holiday programmes?

              <h6>Answer 5</h6>
              <p>
                If you take into account the 12 weeks of school holidays throughout the year, the students actually spend more time in the SC Centre than in their school on a whole year basis. We certainly do not believe in asking the kids to do assessment work from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. during these periods. Hence, we design our holiday programmes with a balanced curriculum combining some serious work with educational games and play. Our games are specially planned to address the academic needs of our children at that particular time. The quality of our teachers ensures that our programmes are well planned and executed.

              <p>
                Do we have students who do not improve or had limited improvement?

            </div>
              <div class="answer">
              <h6>Answer 6</h6>
              <p>
                Except children with learning difficulties who would require specialists’ intervention, by and large, all students who followed our programmes showed improvement. What we are particularly disappointed is that we had not been able to help a small group of children as much as we could perhaps due to a lack of trust or understanding of our capability by their parents. One key difference between us and some SCs or BASCs is that we have a full programme to help raise the students’ academic performance. The child can only benefit from our programme if he follows through the programme. If the child were constantly pulled out to attend other external classes during SC hours or stayed away during school holidays, they would not have spent enough time to benefit fully from our programme. The extent of improvement could therefore be limited.

              <p>
                SCs and BASCs tend to be very localized in terms of student attraction. This is however not the case for us. Take for example our new batch of 2012 P1 students, 40% of them are not residents of Hougang, with 27% from Sengkang and a further 13% from as far as Punggol. Our ability to draw students from Sengkang and Punggol reflects parents’ confidence in our programmes and the management capability of the Centre. </p>
              <p>
                A large number of our student care students are from CHIJ-OLN (Our Lady of the Nativity).  The rest are spread throughout schools in Hougang, Sengkang and Punggol, e.g. Punggol Primary School, Montfort Junior School, Holy Innocent Primary School, Xing Hua Primary, North Vista Primary School, Mee Toh School and Maris Stella High School (Primary).  Most of our tuition students are similarly from these schools.
